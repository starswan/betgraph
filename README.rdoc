== README

We have deliberately pinned ruby version at 2.4.9 for the time being.

There appears to be a clash between ruby 2.5.x, rspec and fixtures
(which we are sadly still using in many places)

which results in not being able to track down errors. This will prevent
the upgrade to Rails 6.x (which needs ruby 2.5+) but we haven't done the rails 5.2
work yet so not really worried there.
